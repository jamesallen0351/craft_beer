# Craft Beer README.md

### “Fill with mingled cream and amber,
### I will drain that glass again.
### Such hilarious visions clamber
### Through the chambers of my brain.
### Quaintest thoughts — queerest fancies,
### Come to life and fade away:
### What care I how time advances?
### I am drinking ale today.”
### - Edgar Allan Poe
