# Craft Beer README.md

### “Fill with mingled cream and amber,
### I will drain that glass again.
### Such hilarious visions clamber
### Through the chambers of my brain.
### Quaintest thoughts — queerest fancies,
### Come to life and fade away:
### What care I how time advances?
### I am drinking ale today.”
### - Edgar Allan Poe

## Working on a craft beer data set to make some visuals, identify takeaways, run some models and then discuss over a beer.

# Executive Summary

- this is where I will write my executive summary

# Planning

- Initial Thoughts:
    - look at the different beer types
    - how many beers are there?

    - is there a most popular beer type? by state?
    - what state / city are breweries most popular?

- import csv files into jupyter notebook
- merge csv files together into new dataframe

# Prepare

- use new dataframe from merged csv files
- check for nulls or missing values
- rename columns for readability
- create sub dataframes for exploration
- create model dataframe for modeling

# Explore

- take a look at some beer stats
- plot most popular beers
- look at percentage of popular beers
- look at beer alcohol by volume

# Modeling

- KNN
- Decision Tree
